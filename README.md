# NOREGRET : *A digit classifier that knows when to stay silent.*




## Overview

Most digit classifiers will confidently assign a label , even when the input is pure noise, a letter, or just a random sketch.

**NOREGRET** is different.  
It‚Äôs a digit classifier that refuses to guess when it's uncertain.

Built on MNIST, NOREGRET uses calibrated confidence and embedding-based reasoning to reject inputs that don't resemble any known digit.

##  What Makes It Different

‚úÖ CNN trained on MNIST  
1. **Beta Calibration** to reduce overconfidence  
2. **Intermediate embeddings** extracted from the model  
3. **Cosine similarity** to class prototypes  
4. Rejects inputs that are far from any known digit cluster or have low confidence

The goal: don't force predictions ‚Äî **know when not to classify**.

## üì∑ Example Behavior

When the given input is a digit : 
<img width="1474" height="878" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8fde0c0-b106-4621-9216-f0c413df7aa6" />

When we test the model with OOD :

Even a small model can learn when to say,  
**"This doesn‚Äôt look like any digit I know."**

## Use Cases

- Out-of-distribution (OOD) rejection  
- Safe AI deployments in constrained domains  
- Teaching calibration and interpretability concepts  
- Baseline for open-set recognition with minimal compute

## Tech Stack

- Tensorflow  
- Scikit-learn  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. Train a simple CNN on MNIST  
2. Apply **Beta Calibration** to output probabilities  
3. Extract embedding from the penultimate layer  
4. Compute **cosine similarity** to pre-computed **class prototypes** (centroids)  
5. If similarity is low **or** confidence is below a threshold ‚Üí **reject**

## üí° Future Directions

- Generalize to other datasets (letters, symbols, multi-modal inputs)  
- Apply to real-world digit inputs (handwritten forms, tablets)  
- Extend to multi-class classifiers beyond digits  
- Visualize embedding space in real time
